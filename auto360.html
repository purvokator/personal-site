    <p>Web and mobile applications for automotive enthusiasts, <br>this application provides all
      automotive services, from news, marketplaces and exhibitions.</p>
    <h2>Main Idea</h2>
    <p>When covid 19 hit, the entire exhibition was affected.<br>
      Entering the new normal period, we think that when
      the exhibition is running, <br>
      we have to adapt to this pandemic.
      As the organizer of the auto show, <br>
      we think that there must be a platform that can accommodate
      all exhibition activities and can also support
      <br>the currently declining automotive industry.
      The platform for all automotive enthusiasts.
    </p><br>
    <h3>How we started</h3>
    <p>We initiated the process using a Design Thinking methodology: <br>Discover, Define, Develop and Deliver.
    </p>
    <hr class="new1">
    <h2>Stage 1: Discover</h2>
    <p>We began with a qualitative investigation, doing unstructured interviews (15 in total) <br>to understand the context and validate the assumptions we made about our users.</p><br>
    <h3>Unstructured interviews</h3>
    <p>This tool is perfect for the exploration stage.
      We needed first-hand information about our users to get
      to know their<br>profound motivations, opinions and perceptions
      about automotive marketplace & exhibition experience.<br>
      <br>
      We designed questions about the following topics:<br>

      • Motivations, fears and expectations.<br>
      • Tools, channels used to buy automotive product.<br>
      • Tools, channels used to visit exhibition.<br>
      • What our users do during the exhibition show.<br>
      • What our users problem during buying automotive product online.<br>
      <br>
      We found pains point & motivations of users. <br>
      Pains:<br>
      • Not accustomed to buying a car / motorcycle online <br>
      • Not comfortable with too many applications <br>
      • Buy a car must see the product <br>
      <br>
      Motivations:<br>
      • Wish there was a platform that contained all automotive needs <br>
      • Buy a car from a trusted one <br>
      Thanks to the interviews, we discovered patterns and found that pains point & motivations
    </p>
    <hr class="new1">
    <h2>Stage 2: Define</h2>
    <p>Now that we had our target user, it was time to synthesize all the information we collected during the interviews.</p><br>
    <h3>Persona</h3>
    <p>We defined an archetype, that is a representation of a group of users, with their motivations, behaviours and fears. <br>
      This tool is designed to help us during all the design process to remember the users’ goals.</p> <br>

    <h3>Design Challenge</h3>
    <p>How do you get Deni to trust and get used to buying automotive products in the online shop? <br>
      And how can we satisfy their automotive needs for exhibitions as well as shopping in one application?</p>
    <hr class="new1">
    <h2>Stage 3: Develop</h2>
    <p>We created solutions using paper prototyping. This method allowed us <br>
      to iterate the original idea and improve the product design faster at a low cost.</p>

    <hr class="new1">
    <h2>Stage 4: Deliver</h2>
    <p>We arrived at the final stage of the process. At this point, we already knew <br>
      the value proposition of our product, the main business objectives and our users’ needs and goals.</p>
    <h3>Wireframing and visual design</h3>
    <p>After made lo-fi sketches to create the different interactions in the app & web. <br>
      We improved this design as you can see in the wireframing image,
      where the navigation tab appears. <br>At this point we started introducing some elements of how the design system would be.
      <br> <br> On the mockups you can see the final screens we designed. <br>
      Creating a simple design system to create our prototype later on with XD.
